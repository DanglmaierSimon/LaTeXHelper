Small Programm to help with my LaTeX-Homework (WIP)

This has probably already been done, better, faster, more efficient and prettier, but i don't care about that, this is mostly for myself to learn programming better.

This is also my first GitHub Project, so be gentle please...

This Project has only been tested on Windows 10, 64-bit, probably wont work on Linux or other OS.

Compilation was done on Visual Studio 2017, i dont know if it works on other versions too.

I guarantee nothing, it may even break your computer, use at your own risk.

Currently the project is built using cmake, so you will need to install cmake and we are currently in the works of using the Poco C++ library for easier use of directories, so this will be needed too.

Poco Library: https://pocoproject.org/download/index.html

Cmake: https://cmake.org/download/
